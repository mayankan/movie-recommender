# Movie Recommendation System - A Dissertation Project with Report based on MovieLens Open Source Dataset

## WHAT IS A RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM?

### A SYSTEM WHICH CAPTURES PATTERNS OF PEOPLE’S BEHAVIOUR AND USE IT TO PREDICT WHAT ELSE THEY WANT OR LIKE.

## TYPES OF RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS

### CONTENT BASED RECOMMENDER SYSTEM
#### THESE RECOMMENDER SYSTEM SHOW RECOMMENDATIONS AS PER USER CHOICE SIMILARITY. FOR EG – A USER RECOMMENDATION OF A MOVIE BASED ON GENRE, I.E. - COMEDY, ADVENTURE, DRAMA, ETC.

### COLLABORATIVE FILTERING BASED RECOMMENDER SYSTEM
#### THESE RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM SHOW RECOMMENDATIONS AS PER NEIGHBOURHOOD POPULARITY OR TRENDING CHOICE CRITERIA. FOR EG – A USER RECOMMENDATION OF A MOVIE BASED ON LATEST CINEMA CHOICES IN THE SAME NEIHBOURHOOD OR AREA.

## CONTENT BASED RECOMMENDER SYSTEM

### MEMORY BASED
#### THERE IS AVAILABILITY OF USER-ITEM DATASET.
#### IT USES STATISTICAL TECHNIQUES TO APPROXIMATE USERS OR ITEMS
#### EXAMPLE - PEARSON CORRELATION, COSINE SIMILARITY, EUCLIDEAN DISTANCE.

### MODEL BASED
#### THERE IS NO AVAILABILITY OF ANY DATASET OF USER RATINGS.
#### IT USES MODEL WHICH LEARNS USER PREFERENCES AND PROVIDES THE RECOMMENDATIONS.
#### EXAMPLE – USING MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS SUCH AS REGRESSION,CLASSIFICATION & CLUSTERING.

## COLLABORATIVE FILTERING BASED RECOMMENDER SYSTEM

### USER BASED
#### BASED ON USER’S SIMILARITY OR NEIHBOURHOOD
#### THERE IS AN ACTIVE USER FOR WHOM THE RECOMMENDATION IS AIMED.
#### HISTORY, PREFERENCES & CHOICES OF ACTIVE_USER IS COMPARED TO OTHER USERS IN THE SAME NEIGHBOURHOOD.

### ITEM BASED
#### BASED ON ITEM’S SIMILARITY
#### SIMILAR ITEMS BUILD NEIGHBOURHOOD ON THE BEHAVIOUR OF THE USERS.
#### IT DOES NOT USE MOVIE’S CONTENT TO COMPARE THE USER ACTIVITY.

##### Note : Code implemented in this repository showcases all the above concepts with data pre-processing before it as it is required in every project before implementing any algorithm to make it work to it's optimum level.
